### Tutorial Source

The initial code and concepts for this project were inspired by the YouTube tutorial series "Machine Learning with Python" more specifically by Sentdex (Harrison Kinsley).

## About the Project

This project aims to classify benign vs malignant breast tumors using the support verctor machine classification algorithm with a sci-kit implementation.

The Implemtation resulted in a ~96% accuracy when classifying between benign and malignant tumors.

## Usage

1. Download the 'breastCancerdata.data' dataset, which will include the column titles.
2. Download the code 'breastCancerSVM.py' and Ensure you have the listed modules installed.
3. Ensure both the code and dataset are in the same working directory.
4. Run.
